### [Riso Color Sandbox](https://erinachavez.github.io/riso_color_sandbox/)

This is a not-so-complex, but very helpful tool for discovering new riso color combinations on the fly! Honestly, made largely for personal experimentation, I decided to expand my original version to include all riso colors in case it could be helpful to others. See it live at [https://erinachavez.github.io/riso_color_sandbox/](https://erinachavez.github.io/riso_color_sandbox/)! Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [p5.riso](https://antiboredom.github.io/p5.riso/).

**Features**
- Create a color palette with any available [riso ink colors](http://stencil.wiki/colors)
- Set your color opacity range from 0 - 255
- 10 ellipse sizes
- Save a full color image and/or each individual riso layer

Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, but please feel free to submit an issue if found! Also if you have any feature suggestions I'm all ears.
